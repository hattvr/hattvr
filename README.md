## **About me**  
I am a 20 year old self-taught developer and graphic designer from America. I started designing roughly 10 years ago back in 2012, and coding about 8 years ago back in 2014. Over the years I have explored various different areas of design and coding and I am highly experienced in several different languages/designing forms.
