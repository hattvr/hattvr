#### About Me
I'm a self-taught developer and graphic designer from the U.S. My journey in design began over a decade ago in 2012, and I started coding a couple of years later in 2014. Throughout the years, I've delved into various aspects of design and development, gaining extensive experience in multiple languages and design disciplines.
